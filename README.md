## Prepare the Environment and Start the App
**This is an instruction for those who don't have a Python environment or aren't familiar with Python programming.**
1. Install Anaconda<br>
   Go to the website https://www.anaconda.com/download and choose the download file with the graphical installer<br>
2. Open Anaconda Navigator<br>
   Just click the "anaconda-navigator.exe" file, which is downloaded under the anaconda folder<br>

4. Click on the "Import" button and choose the corresponding file<br>
   You can find the Anaconda environment file in the GitHub AnacondaEnv folder. The file name is MHOmicsDataProject_20240215.yaml<br>
   Ps. It will take some time to import the environment
